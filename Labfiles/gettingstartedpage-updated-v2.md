# Infrastructure Migration 

### Overall Estimated Duration: 8 Hours

## Overview

In this hands-on lab, you'll migrate and modernize workloads to Azure. You'll start by evaluating and migrating Windows and SQL Server workloads using Azure Migrate and Azure Site Recovery. Next, you'll replicate and migrate a Red Hat VM and OSS DB workloads, enabling Azure AD-based login and connecting to Azure Automanage. Finally, you'll manage a Windows machine with Azure Arc, using Azure Site Recovery for disaster recovery, including test failovers and failovers to Azure VMs.

### Key Features of Infrastructure Migration to Azure

- **Seamless Workload Migration:** Migrate Windows, SQL Server, Linux, and open-source database workloads using Azure Migrate and Azure Site Recovery (ASR). This ensures efficient and secure movement of applications and data from on-premises or other clouds to Azure.

- **Comprehensive Pre-Migration Setup:** Set up your Azure environment with appropriate networking, resource groups, and migration tools. Leverage built-in guidance to ensure your infrastructure is ready for server migration and modernization.

- **Holistic Application and Data Migration:** Use Azure Migrate: Server Migration and tools like the Azure Hybrid Benefit to transition apps and databases with minimal downtime. This includes end-to-end support for migrating application configurations, databases, and dependencies.

- **Optimization of Migrated Workloads:** Post-migration, optimize workloads for performance, cost, and security. Azure tools identify inefficiencies and enable scaling, resource rightsizing, and implementation of best practices across all stacks.

- **Modernization of Linux and OSS Databases:** Leverage Azure's tailored solutions to modernize Linux workloads and open-source databases. Azure ensures compatibility and provides support for scaling and optimizing these environments.

- **Hybrid Cloud Enablement with Azure Arc:** Extend Azure management capabilities to on-premises servers using Azure Arc-enabled server. This enables centralized monitoring, policy enforcement, and management for hybrid environments.

- **Advanced Disaster Recovery and Failover:** Configure Azure Site Recovery (ASR) to protect on-premises infrastructure. Perform test failovers and failover operations to Azure Cloud, ensuring business continuity in case of disasters.

- **Integrated Security and Monitoring:** Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud, Microsoft Sentinel, and Azure Monitor to safeguard workloads post-migration. Integrate with Log Analytics for real-time insights and threat detection across your environment.

- **Business Case Analysis for Strategic Insights:** Conduct business case analysis to evaluate the financial and operational benefits of migration. Utilize Azure's reporting tools to assess cost savings, performance improvements, and ROI.

- **Unified Management and Automation:** Use Azure's centralized platform to manage all migrated workloads, automate processes, and apply consistent governance, security, and compliance across your infrastructure.

## Hands-on Labs Scenario

The following labs provide you with a quick and easy way to get started with Azure Migrate through on-premises environments that do not require any complex set-up or installations. 

For the purposes of these HOLs, let’s consider that SmartHotel is a large hotel company. 

Their IT systems run Windows, Linux, SQL Servers, and MySQL across on-premises data centers, distribution centers, and multiple public clouds. This poses operational challenges for SmartHotel. They’d like a consistent way to govern and operate across these disparate environments, ensure security across the entire organization, and enable innovation and developer agility, all while meeting regulatory and compliance requirements and being able to leverage the latest innovations of database technologies.

## Objective

- **Evaluate and Plan Migration:** Assess your current environment using Azure Migrate, create migration assessments, and configure dependency visualization to ensure a smooth transition.

- **Set Up Azure Environment:** Prepare Azure for migration by creating storage accounts, registering Hyper-V hosts, enabling replication, and configuring networking.

## Architecture

The architecture diagram outlines a series of labs focused on migrating workloads to Azure, configuring Azure services, and leveraging Microsoft tools for optimization and monitoring. The labs begin with migrating Windows, SQL Server, Linux, and OSS database workloads, setting up environments for migration, and utilizing tools like Azure Migrate and the Azure Hybrid Benefit to transition applications and data. Users then onboard on-premises servers to Azure Arc-enabled, configure Azure Site Recovery (ASR) for failover, and migrate infrastructure to Azure. The sequence continues with enabling Microsoft Defender for Cloud, Sentinel, and Azure Monitor while setting up log analytics for security and monitoring, culminating in a business case analysis capability, offering a comprehensive understanding of Azure migration, optimization, and security operations.
